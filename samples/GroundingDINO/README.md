# GroundingDINO DLPK For ArcGIS Pro

This sample showcases a deep learning package (DLPK) to detect object using text prompts in ArcGIS Pro. It is achieved by using GroundingDINO. Grounding DINO is an open set object detector that can find objects given a text prompt. The bounding boxes representing the detected objects are converted to polygons by this model and returned as GIS features.

## Prerequisites
1. ArcGIS Pro 2.3 or later

2. An ArcGIS Image Analyst license is required to run inferencing tools.

3. CPU or NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN

4. Set up the [Python deep learning environment in ArcGIS](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/deep-learning/). 

5. Get familiar with the format and requirements of the *[Esri model definition file (emd)](../../docs/writing_model_definition.md)*.

6. (Optional) Get familiar with *Python raster function*.
*[Anatomy of a Python Raster Function](https://github.com/Esri/raster-functions/wiki/PythonRasterFunction#anatomy-of-a-python-raster-function)*.  
 
7. (Optional) If you are interested in writing custom deep learning Python raster function to integrate additional deep learning
models into ArcGIS, the
*[Custom Python raster function guide](../../docs/writing_deep_learning_python_raster_functions.md)* provides details 
on the necessary functions and how to implement model inference calls using Python raster function.

## Steps for creating DLPK
1. Clone GroundingDINO repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/giswqs/GroundingDINO.git 
   ```
   
2. Install the GroundingDINO from the repository downloaded above by running the command below:
   ```
   pip install --no-deps -e . 
   ```

3. Install the supervision package from pypi using the command:
   ```
   pip install --no-deps supervision==0.6.0
   ```

4. Download the GroundingDINO checkpoint and Config file from the [repo](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO?tab=readme-ov-file#luggage-checkpoints) and point to it in the [GroundingDINO.py](GroundingDINO.py) file.

7. Finally, to create a standalone DLPK, you may create a 7zip archive containing the model weights, source code of grounding_dino along with the EMD and .py inference function from this repo. The archive should be given a DLPK extension.
